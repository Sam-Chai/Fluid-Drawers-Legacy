   Interestingly, and perhaps related, once a fluid drawer is emptied, it still seems to somehow remember the last thing inside it; this makes them impossible to stack afterwards. (已编辑)

   I don't know how Storage Drawers does it, but once all the items are removed (and there's no remembered locked slots), the drawers stack, as long as the upgrades are the same/drawer is empty

   Another strange thing, when fluid drawers have a Creative Storage Upgrade in them, and the fluid is above a certain amount, it shows the current 'capacity' as infinite, but only above a certain number; yet the outside of the drawer will display said number just fine.
